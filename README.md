# NBAdrafter
This is my personal project for the Machine Learning course at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.\
*Performed by Dutchak Bohdan* :sleeping:
<br><br>





## Description
Here will be description of the project generally, also pipelines, technologies explained etc etc.\
Some of the parts will be written on Python3. The reasons of it is the variety of different libraries and tools it has to collect, process and plot data. Also I feel more confident with this language.

## Weekly progress
I like to keep my progress together. Also, since I messed up with deadlines, I decided to handle my progress here. Also, it can be formatted into a fancy page.\
Current progress: **[Week 1](https://github.com/bohdan-dutchak/NBAdrafter/blob/main/README.md#week-1)**.

#### Brief list on notes for this week
  - There are two paradigms of estimation of the model:
    1. Prediction (focusing of the result i.e. the output variable)
    2. Inference (providing analytics of the different trends and relations between variables)
  - Regarding to the paradigms, there is a trade-off between more flexible (Deep learning, SVM, Boosting, Bagging, GAM) and more interpretable models (Lasso, OLS)
  - Learning of the model can be supervised or unsupervised (more rarelly semi-supervised), which depends on the existence of the response variable.
